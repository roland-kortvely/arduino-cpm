This ZIP file contains the original source code to CP/M 2.2. It was written
in PLM. Check out the Intel web site for what is supposed to be the original
PLM compiler used on this source code. It is intended for the ISIS operating
system, and the package includes an ISIS emulator for the PC.

Let us know if anybody succedes in translating the PLM into something more
useful.
