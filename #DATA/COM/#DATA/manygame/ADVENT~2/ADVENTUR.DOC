               RANDY SUESS
               1930 BRADLEY PL
               CHICAGO, ILL 60613

IT WAS RECEIVED WITHOUT ANY CONDITIONS REGARDING
DISTRIBUTION AND NO COPYRIGHT NOTICE IS VISIBLE
IN THE DUMP OF ADVENTUR.OBJ. REFER ALL QUESTIONS
TO RANDY.
  ADVENTUR.OBJ IS THE MAIN PROGRAM. THE INCLUDED
INSTRUCTIONS AND HELP COMMAND SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT
TO GET THE NOVICE STARTED (ASSUMING HE ALSO HAS
48K OF MEMORY AND A REASONABLY FAST DISC SYSTEM).
  THE ADVENTUR.MSG AND *.DAT FILES ARE ACCESSED
FREQUENTLY DURING THE GAME.
  ADVENTUR.MSG PROVIDES THE PLACE, OBJECT, AND
ACTION DESCRIPTIONS. (Please note that it is 
stored in squeezed format on this system).
  ATAB.DAT PROVIDES THE VOCABULARY OF UNDERSTOOD
COMMANDS AND NAMES.

TO COPY THE ADVENTURE GAME TO YOUR OWN SYSTEM,
USE XMODEM TO TRANSFER
   ADVENTUR.OBJ as ADVENTUR.COM
   ADVENTUR.MQG
   and all the .DAT files. 

GUESSING FROM THE CODE IN ADVENTUR.OBJ, I
THINK THAT THIS IS A COMPILED FORTRAN PROGRAM.
AT THIS TIME, NO SOURCE IS AVAILABLE.
